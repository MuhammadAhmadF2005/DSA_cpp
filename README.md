# 🧑‍💻 Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains my personal collection of problem solutions from:

* [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 🟢 (Data Structures & Algorithms, interview prep)
* [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) 🔢 (math-heavy programming challenges)
* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) 🔴 (competitive programming contests)

The main purpose of this repo is to **practice algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving skills** while keeping track of my progress across different platforms.

## ⚡ Languages Used

* Mostly **C++** (with STL, recursion, DP, etc.)
* Occasionally **Python** for quick math-heavy tasks

---

## 🎯 Goals

* Strengthen **DSA concepts**
* Improve **problem-solving speed**
* Build a solid foundation for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming contests**
